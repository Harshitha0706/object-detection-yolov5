# Object Detection using YOLOv5 ðŸš€  

This project implements object detection using the **YOLOv5** model in Python. The model is trained to detect objects like cars in images or live video streams.  

## ðŸ“Œ Features  
âœ… Uses YOLOv5 for real-time object detection  
âœ… Trained on a dataset of cars  
âœ… Works with images and live video  

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used  
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- PyTorch  
- Pandas  
- YOLOv5  

## ðŸ“‚ Installation

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
cd REPO_NAME
pip install -r requirements.txt

## ðŸ“š What I Learned  
âœ… Understanding object detection concepts and how YOLOv5 works.  
âœ… Preprocessing datasets for bounding box detection.  
âœ… Training a machine learning model for object detection.  
âœ… Using OpenCV and PyTorch for image processing.  
âœ… Running YOLOv5 for real-time object detection.  
âœ… Uploading and managing a project on GitHub.
